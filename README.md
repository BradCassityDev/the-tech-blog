# the-tech-blog

## Description

By using this application, users can read and manage blog posts that are tech related. This is done by first creating an account to access their own dashboards which contain a list of their previous blog posts. From here, users can create, update, and delete their posts by interacting with the UI. By creating a session using express-session, the server is able to remember which client is actively connected to grant access to a suite of functions that non authenticated users don't have access to. The UI is rendered using the handlebars templating engine.
